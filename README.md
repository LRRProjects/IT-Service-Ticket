# ITServiceTicket

Develop and design a web application that would evaluate the credentials of the user and determine whether the user could log in to the application as a regular user, technician, or administrator. The user account allows you to create a virtual ticket and see other virtual tickets created from the same account. The technician account allows you to modify virtual tickets properties, such as the ticket status it also allowed the technician to see virtual tickets that have been sent to that technicians account and to leave a remark in the virtual ticket. The administrator account allows you to modify everything about the virtual ticket, from the status to the technician it's assigned to. The technologies used for this project were Microsoft SQL Management Server for the Database, Entity Frameworks, Microsoft Visual Studio and Angular to create the Front End of the application.
